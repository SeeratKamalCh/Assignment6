This code processes an image of a rubiks cube and attempts to apply calibration
technique to find the projection matrix P and instrinsic K and extrinsic 
matrices R of the camera

When the code is run it runs the calibration method and displays the results.

The complete camera calibration procedure can be learned from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M5VUCFrDpE3oC0CQYfbaR4O42HGYqgvX/view
